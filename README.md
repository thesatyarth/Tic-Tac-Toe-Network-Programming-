# Tic-Tac-Toe-Network-Programming-
This is a simple game of tic-tac-toe developed in Python. It allows two players to play with one another on different command lines through networking. The host starts the game by first running host.py, waiting for the client to connect by then running client.py. Once their connected, the game itself starts.
